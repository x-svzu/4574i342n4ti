  },
  {
    question: "Is the Illuminati a secret society?",
    answer: "While we maintain discretion about our specific activities and membership, we are not a 'secret society' in the popular sense.

  },
  {
    question: "How can I become a member?",

  },
  {
    question: "What are the benefits of membership?",

  {
    question: "Do you control world events?",

  },
  {
    question: "What do you actually do?",

  },
  {
    question: "Is the Illuminati religious?",

    answer: "Yes, any adult of good character may apply. We do not discriminate based on gender, race, religion, nationality, or background. We seek individuals who share our commitment to enlightenment and service, regardless of their origin.",
